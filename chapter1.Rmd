## Introduction to Open Data Science 2019
I am attending Introduction to Open Data Science (IODS) course fall 2019.

The course helps participants to understand possibilities of **open science, open data, and open research** tools. Here I will learn to use a few open software tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), and to visualize and analyze data sets with some fairly advanced statistical methods.

My supervisor recommended this course to me, and I believe it will be *very useful* for me.
